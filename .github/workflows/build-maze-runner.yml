          ## Notice

          This repository is automatically maintained through GitHub Actions. The content here is synced from the [daedalus-mono](https://github.com/icarus612/daedalus-mono) repository. Its primary function is to allow others to see a project/collection of micro-projects that I sometimes work on and am mildly proud of.  
          
          ## My Other Projects

          Each of my main projects has its own dedicated repository. You can browse them by visiting my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/icarus612). Here's what you can expect:

          - **Project Overviews**: In each repository, you'll find a detailed README explaining the project's purpose, technology stack, and how to get it up and running.

          - **Code Insights**: Dive into the code to see my coding style and the technologies I work with. Feel free to explore the commit history for a deeper understanding of the development process.
